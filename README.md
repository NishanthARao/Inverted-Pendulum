# Inverted-Pendulum
Simulation of Inverted pendulum with animation on virtual realm 3d tool.

Tune the PID block to play around with the stability of the model.
Pulse is given as an external disturbance to assess the model stability.
Make sure you use the LINEAR dynamics block instead of the non linear dynamics block that has been commented.
