# Inverted-Pendulum
Simulation of Inverted pendulum with animation on virtual realm 3d tool.

Tune the PID block to play around with the stability of the model.
Pulse is given as an external disturbance to assess the model stability.
Make sure you use the LINEAR dynamics block instead of the non linear dynamics block that has been commented.

Uncomment the "Real time pacer" block so that the simulation time reduces to the actual real world time.
Make sure all the files are in one folder.
Run the Init_vars.m file to initialise global variables. Only then run the "Inverted_pendulul.slx" file to view the simulink simulation.
Double click the VR sink block (The one with a pink sphere and a blule square) to see the animation.

Enjoy!
